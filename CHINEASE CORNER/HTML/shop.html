          <p class="font1">
            Dim sum is a style of Chinese cuisine that originated in the
            Guangdong province in southern China and has become popular all over
            the world. It is typically served as small bite-sized portions of
            food served in steamer baskets or small plates and is meant to be
            shared among a group of people.

            satisfying. The soup is often served as a comforting and restorative
            meal, especially when someone is feeling unwell or has a cold.
